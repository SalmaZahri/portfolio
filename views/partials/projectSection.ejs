                <p><strong class="red-color">RadioInsights,</strong>   is an innovative web application I developed using React, Node.js, and Express.js, enhanced with the Shadcn UI library for a sleek and responsive design. The platform allows users to explore and analyze radio archives with smooth, interactive audio playback powered by Wavesurfer.js, featuring detailed waveform visualization. Users can easily search radio shows by date, topic, or station, while Chart.js provides clear and insightful visual statistics on listening trends and archive data.

                <p>
                        Beyond the user experience, I built a dedicated admin dashboard for comprehensive platform management and monitoring. A built-in user guide ensures smooth navigation and maximizes usability. RadioInsights showcases my skills in full-stack development, UI design, audio integration, and data visualization, delivering a dynamic and user-friendly digital solution.

                <p><strong class="red-color">Sweet Home Art,</strong> is a full-stack e-commerce website I developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and a relational database to manage home products with a focus on art and decoration. The site offers a clean, attractive platform where users can browse categories such as tables, paintings, mirrors, and vases, each curated to inspire and beautify living spaces.

                <p>
                      I implemented user authentication, a detailed product catalog with category pages, an intuitive shopping cart, and a smooth checkout process to ensure a seamless buying experience. Additionally, a WhatsApp support feature provides quick customer assistance. This project highlights my ability to create complete web solutions combining front-end design, back-end logic, and database management.

                <p><strong class="red-color">Ekspecto,</strong>   is a detailed and pixel-perfect web prototype I developed as a freelance project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design strictly follows a PSD mockup, requiring exact replication of colors, fonts, dimensions, and layout, including a central double-pane window overlaying a background photo that will later be dynamically changeable by users. This project demanded meticulous attention to detail to ensure the final result matched the original design precisely, while also ensuring full responsiveness across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

                <p>
                       This prototype forms the foundational layout for the full Ekspecto platform, which will eventually incorporate advanced AI and voice recognition features. Working on this project strengthened my skills in layout structuring and responsive web design, critical for creating scalable and visually accurate web applications.

                <p><strong class="red-color">Power BI Strategic Intelligence Project,</strong> In today’s data-driven world, transforming raw data into actionable strategic intelligence is essential for business competitiveness. This academic project focused on leveraging Microsoft Power BI to centralize, analyze, and visualize complex datasets related to sales, services, and human resources. The goal was to create an integrated reporting system that provides clear, real-time insights through interactive dashboards and key performance indicators (KPIs).</p>

                <p>
                   
                  The project involved structuring scattered information into a unified, user-friendly interface that facilitates quick decision-making. It enabled detailed analysis of sales performance across cities, services, and individual sales representatives, assessment of subscription types and profitability, as well as evaluation of sales team effectiveness. This work sharpened my skills in data modeling, visualization, and strategic analysis using Power BI, emphasizing the importance of data-driven management for optimizing commercial and organizational performance.

                <strong class="red-color">Email Marketing & Landing Page Campaign – Mailchimp Project,</strong>
             As part of a digital marketing course, I developed and managed a complete email marketing campaign using Mailchimp. This academic project involved designing three promotional emails for specific occasions: Black Friday, Christmas, and the company's anniversary. Each email was carefully crafted to match the event’s theme, with engaging visuals and clear calls-to-action to encourage customer interaction.</p>


            <p>
               In addition, I created a dedicated landing page to centralize all the special offers featured in the campaign. The page served as a strategic hub, directing recipients from the emails to selected products. This project allowed me to strengthen my skills in campaign planning, email design, and digital communication, while gaining hands-on experience with marketing tools like Mailchimp.
